    <p><a class="aboutme"><i> About Me </a></i></p>

    <p><a class="infoblurb"> My name is Ruthie Dignan, and I am a senior at </a><a class="hs">Owosso High School</a><a class="infoblurb">. </a></p>

    <p><a class="infoblurb"> I have a variety of interests that stretch from critiquing the lowest-rated movies I can find, to growing cacti every year. However, there are two primary interests that come to mind when I think about my future, my passions, and exciting topics in general; business and research science. </a></p>

    <p><a class="infoblurb"> I fell in love with research science at an early age, and became obsessed with the scientific process as I grew older. In my </a><a class="rs">research science portfolio</a><a class="infoblurb">, you will find all the research projects I completed throughout high school. </a></p>

    <p><a class="infoblurb"> My passion for business, however, was discovered at random. During my sophomore year, I decided I would branch out to a club that was out of my comfort zone. Having never shown any interest in business, I was surprised to enjoy the business club I decided on. In my </a><a class="be">business experience folder</a><a class="infoblurb">, you will find all the major activities I did in my business club. </a></p>

    <p><a class="infoblurb"> Computer science is another interest of mine that has guided me heavily throughout high school; learning how to code has helped me express my creativity in a popular media that I was initially brand new to. In my </a><a class="cse">computer science experience folder</a><a class="infoblurb">, you will find all the major projects I coded individually or in a collaboration. </a></p>

    <p><a class="infoblurb"> Outside of school, I enjoy going for walks around my neighborhood, practicing jazz music on guitar but classical music on clarinet, and experimenting with baking and using my family as taste-testers. </a></p>
